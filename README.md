#Project Euler Playground
This repo may contain solutions to problems from https://projecteuler.net. I upload this just to keep track of my work and do not want to take away your joy of solving the problems. If you wish, please only refer to my codes (which, btw, are not optimized) only after you have solved the problems. 

Perhaps we can share our solutions and dicuss?
